# UPDATED: Guaranteed Investment Certificates Calculation
This program is an updated version of the Guaranteed Investment Certificate calculator. It displays available GIC terms and interest rates, asks the user to choose a term and enter an investment amount, and then calculates the total interest earned and final investment value. The program validates user input to ensure a valid GIC term is selected and that the investment amount is greater than zero. Interest is calculated based on the selected term and its corresponding interest rate, and the results are displayed at the end of the program.

  ## How it's made:
